-- Chapter 06: Working with strings
-- Chapter 06 focuses on string manipulation in SQL. Interestingly author

-- complex string manipulation. It makes me wonder if company XYZ is using
-- Java and Python for data processing? (Extract and Transformation).

-- one character at a time. (SQL does not have a loop).
